## Problem Statement
According to WHO, Snakebite is the most deadly neglected tropical disease (NTD), being responsible for a dramatic humanitarian crisis in global health. Snakebites causes human deaths, disability and disfigurement globally every year. It affects poor and rural communities in developing countries, which host the highest venomous snake diversity and the highest burden of snakebite due to limited medical expertise and access to antivenoms. Antivenoms can be life-saving when correctly administered but this often depends on the correct identification of the biting snake.
## Solution
To address this problem in hand, I have developed a web app which helps to classify the species of biting snake using its image powered by Custom Vision. The snakebite victim or people near them takes an image of the biting snake and uploads it into the application which makes an API call to the Azure Custom Vision service to analyze the image and predict the species of the biting snake. In return the prediction of snake species is shown to the victim so that the antivenom is correctly administered to them.
